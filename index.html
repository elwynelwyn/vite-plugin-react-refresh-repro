        Because this is a script type="module" it runs async and will not block loading - that means there is a chance the
        module src/main.tsx below may finish loading and execute before this module runs.
        Here I have changed the backend integration snippet given in the docs slightly to introduce an artificial delay so
        the issue happens consistently. In my real environment the snippet is identical to that provided by the docs.
        I run into the issue consistently, on _some_ pages of my app - guessing it depends on the combination of modules this
        page uses. I don't know why the other module runs faster than this inline snippet, browser caching?
        Or the Vite devserver is just too fast 8)
